1. Junit paramterized function works but it has problem to hard understasnd the case come from
   to complement the parameterized, it need to add the output some information to console to undertand the test case
    for easy to understand the debug.

cyber-dojo great tool to review the growth of the coding
FiceBuzz is simple case can be run by cyber-dojo


annagrams --> this is recursive problem. TDD can easy life on recursive.  And recusive the intuiation way to break down the problem.
cyberdojo, does not easy to import the package, that's annoy.

1. redue the code which have sideEffect; ++index, and index++;
2. good test case will help you to think much better
3. if hard to check is the result is right or bad, you can use different way to cacluate and then check wether they are equal



TDD --calc status

1. When you implement one test case, find that it need another class ,help.  It's good way to stop and record what's you are working on papee; 
And try tdd to implement help or dependenct class, after that return back it implement the exsit one.

Other case, it may use mock to implement.
